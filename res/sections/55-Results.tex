\section{Results}
\label{sec:results}

Through this section we discuss the experimental tested along with the valuation strategy carried out. 

The main purpose of our test is to understand how many tags for each service are correctly addressed. In order to achieve this, we have distributed GHio-Ca to some testers and asked to deselect tags that doesn't concern photos that they have taken. Finally, they have to send the result to us.

Our approch was to make as simple as possible for the tester to contribute: we (i) made a video tutorial in which we have shown what they had to do, (ii) wrote a mini-wiki where the experiment was explained, (iii) modified the application. 



\subsection{Tester version vs Normal one}
We needed to do two main edits to the normal version to be able to carry on the experiment. The first one is about the way we retrieved results from services. In the normal app version the tags are merged together, instead in the test version we did not. Last but not least is how the results are shared. With the test version we only allowed users to share the content with e-mail applications, sending tags and photos to our email address.
