\section{Future work}
Working on this project led us to new features that can be added in the future.
One possible extension of our work is to create our dataset of images and used it in order to classify images. This job could be easly accomplished using, for services such as Clarifai. This service allow to create your own set of pictures and tags, and run images recognition algorithm using them. In order to create the initial set of pictures, it is possible to use the application at that version, distributing that to final users. In this way, exploiting the services we are using in this version of the application and the human interaction (assuming that people share only tags that concern the photo taken) we could have a robust starting set of data that could be reused in the future. 
Another possibility is to specilize the recognition of certain kind of object. Following this idea we have thought that one possible application of that project is to recognize monuments and other historical places around the cities. In order to optimize the recognition process of that kind of pictures it could be useful to take advantage of the user position. In this way the amount of object that could be related to the photo is lower and the classification could be faster and more precise.
