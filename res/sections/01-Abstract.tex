The artificial intelligence is becoming more and more powerful. Thanks to that 
computers are becoming able to recognize object of the real world. This emerging
field of study push industry, vendors and researchers to find better algorithms 
for images and characters recognition. In this context we present the design and
the analisys of an Android application developed in order to exploit the 
possibilities of image recognition.
