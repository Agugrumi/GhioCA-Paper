Artificial intelligence is becoming more and more powerful. Thanks to that, computers are becoming able to recognize object of the real world. This emerging field of study push industry, vendors and researchers to find better algorithms for images and characters recognition. In this context, many efforts have been done by big firms, such as Amazon, Google, IBM and Microsoft. We present the design and the analisys of an Android application developed in order to exploit the possibilities offered by image recognition APIs used for image recognition, comparing and evaluating them.
