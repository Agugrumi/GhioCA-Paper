\section{Know Application problems}

During GhioCA development we found problems with particular smartphones, that
will be listed here.

\subsection{S3 first application run}

We found that with the Samsung S3 (I9300) model permissions were not granted
correctly, resulting in the impossibility to save the users' photos and thus to
perform reverse image search only at the first application run. Debugging did
not produce any evidence of bugs in our application, since the permissions were
granted during App initialization.
We address the issue to the custom ROM flashed on the smartphone, LineageOS
(Android 7.0 Nougat), that probably has some problem handling authorization on
S3 smartphones (since we tried this ROM on a Nexus 5 and we haven't noticed any
strange behavior).
To confirm our guesses we tried another camera available on the Google Play
Store, OpenCamera\footnote{For more infos:
\url{https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.sourceforge.opencamera}},
 an open-source camera that requires Android 4.0.3 (Ice Cream Sandwich) or
later.
Opening it for the first time, granting the permission to write in the external
storage and taking a photo hasn't worked even for this application, confirming
our guesses about a bug in the LineageOS S3 version.
We were not able to solve this issue without restarting the application.
